## The Problem
A new website allows football fans to watch games online. Users like the service as there is no monthly subscription fees, instead they can pay for just the games they want to watch.

The website owners would like to work out which team each user supports so that they know who to send specific team-based marketing emails to. At present they have a list of games watched for each user like this:

    Manchester Utd v Liverpool
    Liverpool v Southampton
    Liverpool v Stoke
    Chelsea v Liverpool

It is easy for humans to work out the likely team that this user supports - it's probably Liverpool as they feature in every game.

## Task
Write a program that will work out the team most likely supported by the user. An array of games watched has been provided for you in `main.py`

## Extension
Create a text file with the match data instead of using an array. Your program should then read from the file.

Don't forget to change the data in the file to test your program works with different data.
